This repository showcases a portfolio website built using React and Three.js. The website is designed to display and highlight your projects and skills in an interactive and visually appealing manner. It leverages the power of React for building a dynamic user interface and incorporates the capabilities of Three.js to create immersive 3D visualizations and animations.

## Features

- **React**: The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that allows for easy management and reusability of UI elements.

- **Three.js**: Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in the web browser. It provides a wide range of features for rendering and animating 3D objects, making your portfolio visually captivating and engaging.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. It ensures that your portfolio looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Project Showcase**: The portfolio website provides a dedicated section to showcase your projects. Each project is presented with a visually appealing card that includes a project image, title, and a brief description. Users can click on a project card to view more details about the project.

- **Project Details**: The project details page provides a comprehensive overview of each project. It includes a detailed description, technologies used, project highlights, and any additional information you want to share. You can also include multiple images or videos to showcase your work.

- **Tech Stats**: Dedicated section for the tech stats I have and what am I working on

## Getting Started

To run the portfolio website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/krishnagithub03/MyPortfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the `cd` command to enter the project directory:

   ```
   cd MyPortfolio
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using a package manager such as npm or yarn. Run either of the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The website will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

5. **Customize the content**: Open the project in your favorite code editor and navigate to the `src` directory. You can modify the existing components or create new ones to tailor the website to your specific needs. Update the project details, images, and 3D visualizations to showcase your own work.

6. **Build and deploy**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can build the optimized production version of the website using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build` directory containing the optimized static files for your website. You can then deploy this directory to a web hosting service or a static file server.
